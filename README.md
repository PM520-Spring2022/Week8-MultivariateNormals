# Week8-MultivariateNormals

The Rmd file in this repo contains the code the the example in which we run an 
MCMC process to estimate the means of a bivariate normal.
Your job is to explore behavior (use Gelman diagnostics: acfs, Scale reduction factors, posterior densities) for each of the 3 cases,
and then try to fix it for the cases in which it performs badly.
